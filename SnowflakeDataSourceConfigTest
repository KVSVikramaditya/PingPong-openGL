## **API Documentation: Download Translated Files**

### **Overview ðŸ“¥**

This endpoint is used to download the content of one or more translated files. After you have identified which files are ready by using the **Get Submission Status** endpoint, you can pass their `targetId`s to this endpoint to retrieve the actual file data.

### **Request Body Structure**

The request requires a JSON object containing your `userId` and a list of `targetId`s for the files you wish to download.

```json
{
  "userId": "vikramad",
  "targetIds": [
    "22621",
    "22622"
  ]
}
```

### **Attribute Definitions**

#### `userId`

This is a **required** string that identifies you as the client. It ensures you only receive files associated with your account.

#### `targetIds`

This is a **required** array of strings, where each string is a `targetId` corresponding to a translated file you want to download.

**Constraint**: You can include a maximum of **25** `targetId`s in a single request. If you need to download more than 25 files, you must send multiple requests.

### **Response**

A successful response will contain the actual translated files corresponding to the requested `targetId`s. The data for each file will be in an **encoded format** (e.g., Base64), ready for you to decode and save.

### **Next Step: Acknowledgment**

Once you have successfully received and processed the downloaded files, you should use the list of `targetId`s in a subsequent acknowledgment call to confirm receipt.
