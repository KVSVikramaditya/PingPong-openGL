I am running into a critical issue identifying benchmarks while working with the dbo.characteristics_mapping_table.

Missing Identifier: The dbo.characteristics_mapping_table does not appear to contain a dedicated benchmark identifier column. This prevents me from definitively linking a characteristic to a specific benchmark.

Question: How should we identify the correct benchmark based only on the available columns in this mapping table?

Proposal for Review: Should we temporarily retrieve all benchmarks associated with a given product_id and process the data?

Missing Data for Products: I've observed that a significant number of product_ids lack entries in the benchmark table, and corresponding column names are also missing.

Question: What is the established procedure for handling these products? Should we assume no benchmark exists, or is there an alternative source we should be using?

Your guidance on how to identify and validate the correct benchmark in these situations is critical to proceeding with the data task.
