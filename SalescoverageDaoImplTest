Hey Jay, hope you’re doing well! Quick context from my OIDC demo: on the client side I’ve got both the client-app ID and the resource-server ID wired up, and on the resource server only its own ID. Flow is basically:

Client creds → Auth server → get JWT

Client calls resource server with that JWT

Resource server intercepts & validates the token → grants access

I’ve got a few quick questions:

Client whitelisting: What’s the cleanest way to only allow certain clients on the resource server? Check the azp/aud claim, inspect headers, or is there a built-in Spring config?

Swagger/UI access: For testing in a browser, do you hook up an Auth-Code flow or just drop in a token manually?

WebStax setup: Any tips on the route spec acClientIds, profiles to enable, or gotchas when the gateway enforces client-credentials?

Docker → WebStax: Best practices for building the image (env vars, JWK URIs), updating the WebStax spec, and handling private-key JWT secrets?

Could you hop on a quick Teams call today to chat through any time you’re free? Would really appreciate it!
