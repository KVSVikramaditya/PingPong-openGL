To register your application for OIDC, you use the firm's self-service registration portal, which is available for each environment (Dev, QA, Prod).

The process is as follows:

Navigate to the OIDC Registration Page: Access the portal for the specific environment you are working in (e.g., the "dev" instance of PingFederate).

Create a New Registration: Using the provided API interface (a Swagger UI), you will submit a request to create a new client.

Provide Application Details: You will need to define how your application will operate by specifying key information, including:

Grant Type: authorization_code for user logins or client_credentials for server-to-server communication.

Scopes: The permissions your application needs (e.g., openid, profile).

Redirect URI: The secure URL the user will be sent back to after logging in.

Receive Your Credentials: Once submitted, the system automatically:

Generates a unique Client ID for your application.

Creates a corresponding Client Secret (or private key) and stores it securely in the Secured Credential Vault (SCV), ready for your application to use.
