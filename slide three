1. Setup: During registration, a Public/Private Key pair is created for the application. The sensitive Private Key is stored in the SCV (Secured Credential Vault).

2. Request: The client creates a JWT asserting its identity (Client ID) and signs it using the Private Key fetched from the SCV.

3. Verification: The Authorization Server receives the request and uses the client's corresponding Public Key to validate the JWT's signature.

4. Issuance: Once the signature is verified, the server issues an Access Token, which the client can now use to access resources.
