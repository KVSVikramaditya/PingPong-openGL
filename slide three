## **API Documentation: Get Submission Status**

### **Overview ðŸ“–**

This endpoint allows a client to retrieve the status of their translation submissions. By providing a `userId`, you can query for submissions that are in a specific state (e.g., in process, processed). The primary purpose of this endpoint is to get a list of `targetId`s for completed translations, which can then be used to download the final translated files.

### **Request Body Structure**

The request requires a JSON object containing the `userId` and an optional `status` array to filter the results.

```json
{
  "userId": "vikramad",
  "status": [
    "IN PROCESS"
  ]
}
```

### **Attribute Definitions**

#### `userId`

This is a **required** string that identifies you as the client. The service uses this ID to fetch all submissions associated with your account.

#### `status`

This is an **optional** array of strings that acts as a filter for the submission status. You can include one or more status values to get all `targetId`s that match those states.

  * **If you provide a status** (e.g., `["IN PROCESS"]`), the API will return a list of all target IDs that are currently in that state.
  * **If you omit the `status` field entirely**, the API will default to returning only the target IDs for submissions that have been **`PROCESSED`**. This is the most common use case for fetching files that are ready for download.

### **Response**

The response to this request will be a list of `targetId`s that match the specified filter criteria. You can then use these `targetId`s in subsequent API calls to download the actual translated documents.
