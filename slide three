Slide 3: How a Client Gets an Access Token (The Client Credentials Flow)
Before a Client Server can access a Resource Server, it must first prove its own identity to the Authorization Server to get a token. We use a very secure method that relies on a public/private key pair instead of a simple shared secret.

Step 1: One-Time Registration and Key Setup

When the application is registered, a Public/Private Key pair is generated for it.

The Public Key is stored by the Authorization Server alongside the Client ID.

The highly sensitive Private Key is stored in the firm's SCV (Secured Credential Vault), never in the application's code.

Step 2: The Client Creates and Signs a JWT

To request a token using the Client Credentials grant, the Client Server first creates its own JWT (JSON Web Token).

This JWT contains claims proving its identity, such as its iss (issuer) and sub (subject), which are both set to its Client ID.

Crucially, the client then signs this JWT using its Private Key, which it retrieves securely from the SCV. This digital signature proves it is who it claims to be.

Step 3: The Authorization Server Verifies the Signature

The Client sends this signed JWT to the Authorization Server.

The server looks up the Public Key associated with the Client ID from the JWT.

It uses the Public Key to verify the JWT's signature. If the verification succeeds, it proves the request came from the legitimate application and has not been tampered with.

Step 4: The Access Token is Issued

Once the client's identity is successfully verified, the Authorization Server issues a new Access Token.

The Client Server can now use this token to make secure, authorized calls to the Resource Server.
